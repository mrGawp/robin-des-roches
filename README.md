My cousin's website for his landscaping company Robin Des Roches built entirely from scratch in vanilla HTML, CSS & javascript.

Frontend:
- vanilla css, html & anine.js.

Backend:
- nodeJS
- nodemailer
- multer, to handle user files and link them in the email.
- handlebars, viewengine for the html sent in email
